What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging combines changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit. It will preserve branch history and is generally safer with fewer conflicts. Rebasing rewrites the commit history of a branch, making it look like changes were made directly 
on top of another branch. It results in a linear history but can lead to conflicts during the process. You should choose merging when you want to preserve complete history, and use rebasing for a cleaner, linear history.

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Merging combines changes from one branch into another, creating a merge commit. It preserves branch history and is generally safer with fewer conflicts. Rebasing rewrites the commit history of a branch, making it appear as if changes were made directly on top of another branch. This results in a linear history but can lead to conflicts during the process. You should choose merging when you want to preserve complete history, and use rebasing for a cleaner, linear history, especially for feature branches.
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a version control repository that exists on a different location or server from your local repository. It acts like a central or shared repository where multiple developers can work on a project by pushing and pulling code changes.
